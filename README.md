Install:
Botit and Botit project are Both fully portable and can run from disk on key or any folder.
both will self deploy in the folder.

BotIt Installer:
A image crop tool with easy demo targets to show user what to snap.
user left click of title. wiat for overlay and right drag the area he want to snap.
Botit installer will snap the target in RGB/grayscale and will save the cords of the target to allow user area scan for it.
it will auto save / overwrite the img to the bot img folder with the name botit use.
so above crop like demo image show no real install is needed. only crop the stuff you  want botit to click or detect with the installer. (5 min tops! can snap while bot running to see its react correct)

Bugs:

window size. while moving the window or stacking few window's on each other will not be any issue
changing the window size after cropping images will break the images you crop.
you cant detect image you cropped on 800*600 if you resize window to 960*540....
